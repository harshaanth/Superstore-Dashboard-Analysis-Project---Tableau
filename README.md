## Project Overview
This Tableau project analyzes sales and profit performance for a fictional Superstore, focusing on regional and product-based insights. The dashboards are interactive, allowing users to filter and navigate seamlessly between views for a comprehensive data exploration experience.

- **Context**: Analyzed regional and product-specific performance to identify profitable and underperforming areas.
- **Action**: Created two interactive dashboards—**Profits by Location** and **Profit Analysis**—with cross-dashboard filtering and navigation.
- **Results**: Enabled users to filter by region, view detailed product data, and navigate smoothly between dashboards.
- **Learning**: Gained experience with Tableau’s filter actions, cross-dashboard linking, and navigation buttons to enhance user interactivity.

## Key Insights
- **Profit and Loss Distribution**: Certain regions and products drive high sales but vary in profitability.
- **Product Sub-Category Performance**: Categories like **Binders** and **Chairs** show low profitability, while **Labels** and **Paper** perform well.
- **Regional Trends**: Regional disparities in performance can guide strategy adjustments.

## Techniques Used
- **Cross-Dashboard Filtering**: Filters data by selected regions across dashboards.
- **Dynamic Filter Actions**: Enables detailed views by user clicks.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Provides seamless movement between dashboards.
- **Contextual Formatting**: Guides users with clear labels and interactive cues.

## Project Tasks
1. **Region Selection Crosstab**: Created a view to display and filter regions.
2. **Integrated Region Filter**: Added region selection as a filter in the **Profits by Location** dashboard.
3. **Cross-Dashboard Filter Action**: Linked **Region Selection** to **Profit Analysis** with a menu-triggered filter action.
4. **Navigation Button**: Added a button in **Profit Analysis** to return to **Profits by Location**.
5. **Final Adjustments**: Aligned elements, hid unnecessary sheets, and confirmed functionality.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates Tableau’s capabilities in creating interactive, user-friendly dashboards for data-driven insights. The setup allows users to easily analyze and navigate Superstore’s regional and product data for informed decision-making.
